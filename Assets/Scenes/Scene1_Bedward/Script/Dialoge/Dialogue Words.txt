Nurse
You are recovering quickly, but you will need to stay here for a few more days and we will do more tests to make sure there is nothing else wrong with you. 
On the table are your personal belongings.
Another question is, do you have any emergency contacts, we can't find any records of them.
You cannot leave this room until you have contacted them.
